Independent verification: W_infty[lambda] -> E_infty^top is CONDITIONAL.

CLAUDE.md sec. 3 Vol II thesis: iterated Sugawara topologisation
reaches E_infty^top via W_{1+infty}; specifically the topologisation
ladder
    affine KM (non-critical) -> E_3
    W_N                       -> E_{N+1}
    W_infty[lambda]           -> E_infty^top  (Platonic endpoint)
holds CONDITIONAL on four hypotheses:
  hypProchazka  -- Prochazka's W_infty[lambda] universal triangle
  hypCKL        -- Costello-Kapranov-Li 6d hCS quartic obstruction
  hypPRSh       -- Pope-Romans-Shen W_infty Cartan / structure constants
  hypYamada     -- Yamada chain-level lift of the topologisation ladder

Voice-table row 14:
  forbidden: "W_infty -> E_infty"
  allowed:   "conditional on hypProchazka, hypCKL, hypPRSh, hypYamada"

CLAIM ASSERTED HERE
-------------------
The test asserts the STRUCTURE of conditionality (four hypotheses,
each separately load-bearing, none redundant) plus the FINITE-N
witness: W_3 -> E_4^top, W_4 -> E_5^top is verifiable directly without
the four hypotheses, by Pope-Romans-Shen Cartan analysis.

The unconditional W_infty -> E_infty would require all four; this test
verifies the conditional structure, NOT the unconditional claim.

DISJOINT ROUTE
--------------
Two independent routes meeting at finite N:
  Route A (finite-N direct): Pope-Romans-Shen explicit Cartan structure
    of W_3 / W_4, plus Sugawara topologisation height for finite-rank
    affine algebras, gives the topologisation height N + 1 for W_N.
  Route B (asymptotic): the W_infty[lambda] universal triangle of
    Prochazka requires the four conditional hypotheses to lift the
    finite-N pattern to N -> infty.

The DICHOTOMY is the disjoint witness: finite N is unconditional;
infinite N is conditional. The four hypotheses name the precise gap
between Route A's finite witness and Route B's infinite endpoint.
