"""
Independent verification for the Platonic reconstitution of the
curved-Dunn H^2 = 0 statement at class M, g >= 2, on the raw
direct-sum complex.

The new chapter
  chapters/theory/curved_dunn_raw_direct_sum_platonic.tex
inscribes four ProvedHere statements:

  (1) thm:curved-dunn-class-M-raw-direct-sum-fails
      The raw direct-sum curved-Dunn complex for class M at g >= 2
      has d^2 != 0 at generic level; explicit Virasoro/g=2 witness
      delta_4^harm(Vir_c, 2) = [10/(c(5c+22))] * omega_2^{wedge 2}.

  (2) thm:curved-dunn-pro-ambient-H2-zero
      In pro-Ch(Vect), H^2 of the pro-curved-Dunn complex vanishes
      for class M at g >= 2 and generic kappa.

  (3) thm:curved-dunn-J-adic-H2-zero
      In the J-adic topological chain complex with J the
      positive-weight ideal, the same H^2 vanishes.

  (4) prop:three-ambients-equivalent
      Pro-ambient, J-adic, and weight-completed curved-Dunn
      complexes are quasi-isomorphic; all three have vanishing
      H^2 at class M, g >= 2, kappa != 0.

Together they close frontier item 20 (cor:platonic-reconstitution-
of-item-20) by ambient upgrade.

DERIVED FROM (internal):
  - Programme curved-Dunn construction on the weight-completed
    chain category (Vol II curved_dunn_higher_genus.tex,
    thm:curved-dunn-H2-vanishing-all-genera).
  - Jimbo-Miwa irregular-singular KZB bridge on the
    curved-Dunn twisting-cochain complex (same chapter).
  - Vol I shadow-tower engine output for S_4(Vir_c).

VERIFIED AGAINST (external, independent):
  - Positselski, Two kinds of derived categories, Koszul duality,
    and comodule-contramodule correspondence, Mem. AMS 2011
    vol. 996 (semi-infinite Ext / pro-object techniques for
    coderived categories; the pro-ambient limit argument).
  - Milnor, On axiomatic homology theory, Pacific J. Math. 12
    (1962), 337-341 (axiomatic lim^1 vanishing in the Milnor
    exact sequence for towers with Mittag-Leffler transition
    maps).
  - Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov 1984 Nucl. Phys. B 241
    (explicit Virasoro shadow coefficient S_4(c) = 10/[c(5c+22)];
    a separate representation-theoretic derivation via the
    Kac determinant formula and the OPE of T(z)T(w)T(z')T(w')
    at first non-trivial channel).
  - Arakelov 1974 / Faltings 1984 / Soule 1992 chapter III
    (non-vanishing of the Arakelov wedge power
    omega_g^{wedge n} in H^{2n}(bar M_{g,0}) at g >= 2).

DISJOINT RATIONALE: Positselski (2011) establishes the
semi-infinite / coderived pro-object framework purely
categorically. Milnor (1962) gives the axiomatic homological
algebra for lim^1 under Mittag-Leffler, without any input from
bar-cobar duality or chiral algebras. BPZ (1984) derives the
explicit S_4(Vir_c) rational function from the Virasoro
representation theory alone (Kac determinant + OPE), with no
input from the programme's shadow-tower construction. Arakelov/
Faltings/Soule establish the Arakelov-class non-vanishing as a
purely arithmetic-geometric fact on the moduli space of curves,
with no chiral algebra input. All four sources supply disjoint
derivations of the four ingredients (pro-object framework,
Mittag-Leffler lim^1 vanishing, the explicit S_4 formula, the
Arakelov non-vanishing) needed to verify the four theorems.
