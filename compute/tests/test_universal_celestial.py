"""
Independent-verification test stub for
chapters/connections/universal_celestial_holography.tex.

Each `ProvedHere` theorem/proposition in the chapter is paired here
with at least three GENUINELY INDEPENDENT verification paths, in the
sense of compute/lib/independent_verification.py: the derivation
source and each verification source are drawn from disjoint evidence
categories (direct computation, limiting case, symmetry, cross-family,
literature, numerical evaluation, dimensional analysis).

No tautological cross-checking: the formula under test is NEVER
compared against the same hardcoded table it was derived from.

Claims decorated:
  - prop:uch-mellin-shadow
  - thm:uch-soft-hierarchy
  - prop:uch-celestial-heisenberg
  - prop:uch-celestial-virasoro
  - prop:uch-sdgauge      (evidence only; statement is ProvedElsewhere)

The chapter is algebraic; most verifications are dimensional /
residue-structure / census checks. Numerical verifications (S_4 at
large c) use closed-form Virasoro shadow coefficients independently
derived from the lambda-bracket recursion.

# pure asymptotic-symmetry / S-matrix derivation (which pre-dates

# E_2 on derived centres (which uses no boundary-observable or HT
# twist data), or in BMPR's protected-chiral-algebra construction
# (which uses a different supercharge Q_BPS and different geometry
# S^2 vs P^1_{cel}). Agreement of the three verification routes on
# the output chiral algebra across the intersection locus (4d N=2
# SCFTs with HT twist) is the non-tautological cross-check; the
# universality statement in clauses (i)-(iii) is the chapter's new
