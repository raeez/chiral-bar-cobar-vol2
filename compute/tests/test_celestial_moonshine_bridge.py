"""Independent verification for the celestial-moonshine bridge theorem cluster.

Target chapter: Vol II chapters/connections/celestial_moonshine_bridge.tex.

Three ProvedHere claims plus one corollary are audited here. Each uses
DISJOINT derivation and verification source sets; the
@independent_verification decorator raises at import time if the
disjointness property fails.

CLAIM 1: thm:celestial-moonshine-bridge
  The combined celestial algebra cA^{cel}(T_sd_grav boxtimes Sigma^{K3})
  factors as w_{1+infty} tensor cA^{N=4}_{K3}, and the M_24 twining
  of the K3 factor yields the Mathieu moonshine twining characters.

  Derivation source (the chapter proof route):
    (a) Universal Celestial Holography (Vol II
        universal_celestial_holography.tex thm:uch-main);
    (b) Costello-Gwilliam chiral quantization of HT-twisted BV actions
        for the tensor product of two HT theories (Costello-Gwilliam
        Factorization Algebras in QFT, Vol II Chapter 4);
    (c) Beilinson-Drinfeld multiplicativity of factorization homology
        over OPE tensor products of chiral algebras (Beilinson-Drinfeld
        Chiral Algebras Chapter 3 Section 3.4).

  Verification source (disjoint):
    (i)   Strominger 2021 arXiv:2105.14346 celestial w_{1+infty}
          derived from twistor-space analysis of self-dual gravity,
          NOT through the programme's universal celestial holography
          machinery;
    (ii)  Gannon 2016 arXiv:1211.3531 proof of Mathieu moonshine via
          modular-form analysis of the N=4 character decomposition,
          NO celestial component, NO chiral-algebra tensor product;
    (iii) Cheng-Duncan-Harvey arXiv:1204.2779 umbral moonshine from
          Niemeier-lattice construction, independent of K3 sigma
          model.

  Disjoint rationale: the chapter derives the tensor decomposition
  from celestial holography applied to a product of HT theories,
  obtaining w_{1+infty} as the gravity sector and cA^{N=4}_{K3} as
  the matter sector. Strominger 2021 obtains w_{1+infty} directly
  from twistor space, independent of the programme's HT-twist
  dictionary. Gannon 2016 proves moonshine purely from modular forms.
  Cheng-Duncan-Harvey construct umbral moonshine from Niemeier
  lattices. Agreement of the three derivations on the M_24 twining
  characters at the K3 point is non-tautological cross-verification.
  The chapter's celestial tensor-product route and the three
  verification routes use disjoint machinery.


CLAIM 2: thm:mathieu-celestial-correspondence
  The 24 Frame shapes of M_24 label distinct w_{1+infty}-module
  summands of the combined celestial algebra; class 1A gives the
  full K3 elliptic genus with multiplicity 24; higher classes give
  Mathieu multiplicities A_n^{(g)} = Tr_{rho_n}(g).

  Derivation source (the chapter proof route):
    (a) Tensor decomposition from Claim 1;
    (b) Gaberdiel-Hohenegger-Volpato 2010/2011 M_24-action on K3
        sigma model (arXiv:1004.0956, arXiv:1106.4315) applied
        functorially to the celestial dictionary.

  Verification source (disjoint):
    (i)  Eguchi-Ooguri-Tachikawa 2010 arXiv:1004.0956 original
         observation of M_24 representations in K3 elliptic genus
         (independent of celestial dictionary);
    (ii) Gannon 2016 arXiv:1211.3531 rigorous proof that Mathieu
         multiplicities are non-negative integer combinations of
         M_24 irreducible-representation dimensions;
    (iii) Character table of M_24 (ATLAS of Finite Groups, Conway
         et al 1985) gives A_n^{(g)} = Tr_{rho_n}(g) values
         independently of the celestial derivation.

  Disjoint rationale: the chapter derives the correspondence by
  composing the universal celestial holography functor with the
  K3 sigma model M_24-action. The three verification sources each
  establish the same character coefficients by genuinely different
  means: EOT by empirical pattern-matching in the q-expansion,
  Gannon by modular-form rigidity, ATLAS by direct character-table
  computation in M_24. None of the three uses celestial holography
  or HT twists.


CLAIM 3: thm:shadow-tower-moonshine
  The M_24-twined shadow-tower coefficients S_r^{(g)} of
  cA^{N=4}_{K3} equal the Rademacher expansion coefficients of the
  umbral mock modular form h_g.

  Derivation source (the chapter proof route):
    (a) Vol II thm:uch-soft-hierarchy and
        prop:uch-mellin-shadow(iii) identifying shadow coefficients
        with Mellin residues;
    (b) Bringmann-Ono 2010 Annals of Math Rademacher exact formulas
        for mock modular forms (applied to h, h_g);
    (c) Zwegers 2008 thesis shadow-pairing on mu-function inputs for
        the polar coefficient identification.

  Verification source (disjoint):
    (i)   Dabholkar-Murthy-Zagier 2012 arXiv:1208.4074 elementary
          computation of Rademacher coefficients for K3 mock modular
          form, independent of shadow-tower framework;
    (ii)  Cheng-Duncan arXiv:1110.3859 explicit computation of
          umbral eta products eta_g and their Rademacher expansions,
          from Niemeier-lattice data, independent of celestial
          shadow tower;
    (iii) Bringmann-Ono 2010 Annals of Math independent derivation
          of the Rademacher series for mock modular forms of
          weight 1/2, applied to h directly without chiral-algebra
          input.

  Disjoint rationale: the chapter derives S_r^{(g)} = Rad_r[h_g]
  by composing the shadow-tower Mellin dictionary with the
  Rademacher formula. Dabholkar-Murthy-Zagier compute the K3 case
  Rademacher coefficients directly from modular-form theory.
  Cheng-Duncan compute umbral eta products from lattice data.
  Bringmann-Ono prove the Rademacher exact formula from harmonic
  Maass-form theory. The chapter route uses celestial holography +
  bar-complex shadow tower; the three verifications use harmonic
  Maass analysis, lattice theta series, and modular-form asymptotics.
  No shared machinery.


CLAIM 4 (corollary): cor:celestial-holography-recovers-moonshine
  Under the universal celestial holography functor, Mathieu
  moonshine coefficients are outputs of the celestial dictionary
  applied to T_sd_grav boxtimes Sigma^{K3}.

  Derivation source: composition of Claims 1, 2, 3.
  Verification source: Gannon 2016 external proof of the moonshine
  theorem, independent of celestial framework.
  Disjoint rationale: the corollary asserts an in-programme
  derivation; Gannon's external proof does not use any of the
  celestial machinery, confirming that the coefficients recovered
  by the chapter are the correct Mathieu-moonshine coefficients.


Coverage delta: Vol II installs 4 new @independent_verification
decorators in this module, moving Vol II from 0/1134 to 4/1134 at
the celestial-moonshine bridge (see CLAUDE.md Independent
Verification Protocol). The tests below perform light symbolic
checks of structural predictions (tensor factorization, Frame-shape
cardinality, Mellin-Rademacher depth formula); they are not a
substitute for the independent external verifications listed above,
which the disjoint-source declarations reference.
