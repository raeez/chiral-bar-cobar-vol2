"""Independent-verification decorators for the Unified Chiral Quantum Group chapter.

Target chapter: Vol II chapters/theory/unified_chiral_quantum_group.tex.

Covers five structural probes for the unified chiral-bialgebra chapter.
These tests are convention guards and independent sanity checks on
verified fibres; they are not a proof of the full general existence
theorem.

    thm:unified-chiral-QG
    thm:coproduct-via-miura
    thm:typeA-baxter-Q
    thm:DS-L-to-M-universal
    thm:langlands-nonsimplylaced

Each decorator names derived_from + verified_against source sets that are
genuinely disjoint. The tests re-derive the claimed quantities from primary
arithmetic and structural facts (elementary symmetric functions, Cartan
matrix data, Yangian PBW, Baxter TQ, Feigin-Frenkel screening), never from
an engine output of this programme.
