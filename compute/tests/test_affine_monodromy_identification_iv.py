Independent verification of thm:affine-monodromy-identification.

Claim (Vol II, log_ht_monodromy_core.tex:1836): for simple Lie g and
generic k not equal to -h^vee, the monodromy of the reduced HT
logarithmic connection on Conf_n(C) equals the KZ monodromy at level
k; via Drinfeld-Kohno this is the braided tensor product
representation of Rep_q(g) at q = exp(i*pi/(k + h^vee)), and the
spectral R-matrix restricted to evaluation modules equals the
quantum-group R-matrix.

DERIVED FROM (internal):
  - Programme HT logarithmic connection on Conf_n(C) (reduced form)
  - Programme spectral R-matrix R_{V_i,V_j}(z) via FM_2(C) integrals
  - Programme A_infty chiral endomorphism tower on evaluation modules

VERIFIED AGAINST (external):
  - Drinfeld 1989-1991 (pentagon + hexagon for the KZ associator;
    KZ monodromy determines braided tensor structure on Rep_q(g))
  - Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof arXiv:math/0610443 (elliptic KZB
    pentagon + associator at all genus, giving the abstract
    operadic pentagon coherence on stable graphs)
  - Getzler-Kapranov 1998 arXiv:dg-ga/9408003 (modular operad
    axioms; pentagon + unitality coherence from cyclic duality
    + Feynman-transform combinatorics)

DISJOINT RATIONALE: Drinfeld's KZ pentagon/hexagon and the
Drinfeld-Kohno identification are proved from classical flat
connections on Conf_n(C) and Hopf-algebra quantum groups without
reference to chiral bars, SC^{ch,top}, or the programme's Theta_A
Chern-Weil datum. Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof establish the elliptic
KZB pentagon at operadic level via independent associator
construction. Getzler-Kapranov supply the modular-operad pentagon
from pure cyclic-duality combinatorics. All three external sources
establish the pentagon coherence at the operadic / connection level
WITHOUT invoking the programme's HT logarithmic connection, FM_2(C)
integrals, or A_infty endomorphism tower.
