"""Independent-verification decorators for the SC^{ch,top} heptagon.

Target chapters: chapters/theory/sc_chtop_heptagon.tex and
chapters/connections/spectral-braiding-core.tex.

Covers three ProvedHere claims and one conditional structural witness:

    thm:sc-heptagon           (spectral-braiding-core.tex)
    thm:heptagon-closed       (sc_chtop_heptagon.tex)
    thm:heptagon-collapse     (sc_chtop_heptagon.tex)
    thm:drinfeld-centre-sc-face (conditional; structural witness only)

Each decorator pairs the chapter's internal operadic derivation
against an independent algebraic source that computes the same
structural data via a non-operadic route (shifted-symplectic DAG,
Drinfeld centre fusion, Tamarkin chain-level transfer, Hoefel
Koszulity).

All work attributed to Raeez Lorgat.
