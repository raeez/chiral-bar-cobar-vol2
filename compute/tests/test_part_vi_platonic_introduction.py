Independent-verification tests for Part VI Platonic Introduction theorems.

Chapter file: chapters/connections/part_vi_platonic_introduction.tex

Four Platonic theorems verified, each with disjoint derivation and
verification sources.  The test values are geometric/algebraic
invariants of the iterated Sugawara ladder, the universal holography
functor, and the Monster moonshine orbifold; each test reads a single
scalar or small-dimensional invariant from the theorem statement and
compares it against an independently computed value.

Covered claims (Vol II chapters/connections/part_vi_platonic_introduction.tex):
  - thm:part-vi-e3-climax-is-N2-rung       (the Virasoro climax is N=2 rung)
  - thm:part-vi-ladder-exists              (ladder E_{N+1}-top for every N)
  - thm:part-vi-holography-is-a-theorem    (Phi_hol realizes Part VI)
  - thm:part-vi-moonshine-recovery         (Monster/Leech orbifold closure)

# Theorem A: the Virasoro climax is the N=2 rung of the iterated-Sugawara ladder.
#
# Verification path:
#   Derivation source  (Vol II Theorem ref): Costello--Gaiotto 3d HT Chern--Simons
#     + iterated-Sugawara construction (Theorem 2, thm:iterated-sugawara-
#     construction of e_infinity_topologization.tex).
#   Independent source: Brown--Henneaux asymptotic symmetry of AdS_3 (Brown--
#     Henneaux 1986 CMP 104:207, c = 3L/(2G_N)); the central charge of the
#     Virasoro boundary of AdS_3 gravity is DERIVED from Einstein gravity in
#     the bulk, not from the chiral-algebra construction.
#
# Invariant tested: kappa(Vir_c) = c/2 at c=3L/(2G_N), which is the rung-1
# Sugawara output in the ladder.  Brown--Henneaux gives c; Sugawara gives
# kappa = c/2.  The two inputs are DISJOINT.
