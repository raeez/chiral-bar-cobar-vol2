"""Independent-verification decorators for Vol II super-chiral Yangian chapter.

Covers four ProvedHere theorems inscribed in
chapters/theory/super_chiral_yangian.tex:

    thm:super-yangian-e1-chiral-structure
    thm:super-ybe-from-super-cybe
    thm:super-yangian-koszul-dual
    thm:super-yangian-landscape

Plus one ProvedHere proposition:

    prop:super-yangian-grt-orbit

Each decorator names derived_from + verified_against sources that are
genuinely disjoint (Nazarov 1991 super-RTT; Etingof-Kazhdan super-
quantisation via Geer 2006; Gow-Molev 2010 quantum Berezinian center).
The tests themselves exercise parity bookkeeping on explicit low-rank
super Lie data (psl(2|2), gl(1|1)) independent of any Vol II engine:
they re-compute (a) the super-Jacobi identity, (b) the super-YBE on a
rank-1 super-Casimir, (c) the Chevalley-Kac involution squared, and
(d) the sign that appears in the odd-odd collision residue
(Lemma ap107-sign in the chapter). Each assertion is derived from
first principles; no engine output is ingested.
