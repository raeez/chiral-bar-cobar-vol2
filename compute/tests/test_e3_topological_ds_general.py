"""Independent verification for thm:E3-topological-DS-general.

Vol II, chapters/connections/3d_gravity.tex:6805. Theorem:
    For g simple, f in g any nilpotent with sl_2-triple (e, h_0, f),
    k != -h^v, W^k(g,f) the quantum DS reduction. The 3d HT Chern-Simons
    on X x R with DS boundary conditions has boundary chiral algebra W,
    and its BV-BRST complex satisfies T_DS(f) = [Q_CS, G'_f] on
    Q_CS-cohomology, producing an E_3-topological structure on
    Z^{der}_{ch}(W).

Derivation source
-----------------
Costello-Gaiotto holomorphic Chern-Simons with DS boundary conditions
(arXiv:1804.06460 + arXiv:2103.01042 + follow-ups), PLUS the
Kazhdan-graded BRST identity T_DS = T_Sug + improvement terms with
the improvement always lying in the Cartan currents (AP81 scope
restriction: hook-type nilpotents and principal case verified; more
general good-integer-graded nilpotents conditional on
ghost-bilinear Cartan-only-correction).

Verification source (disjoint)
------------------------------
Bershadsky-Polyakov free strong generation per de Boer-Tjin 1993
(Commun. Math. Phys. 160, 317-332). For f = f_min in sl_3, the
DS output is W_3^(2) = Bershadsky-Polyakov. De Boer-Tjin construct
BP directly from screened free fields in 1993 -- predating Costello-
Gaiotto by two decades and making no appeal to holomorphic Chern-
Simons, Q_CS-exactness, or Kazhdan grading. Their free-strong-
generation statement combined with Fateev-Lukyanov explicit OPE
tables (Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 3 (1988) 507-520) provide an
independent route to BP's conformal vector and stress tensor;
E_3-topological structure on Z^{der}_{ch}(BP) is then obtained by
applying the abelian Heisenberg template (three free bosons) +
screening-invariant projector, which is a Feigin-Frenkel-style
intersection construction disjoint from holomorphic CS.

The two routes agree on BP's central charge c^BP = -2(k+3)(3k+1)/(k+3)
and on the vanishing of the Sugawara-DS improvement obstruction in
the Cartan direction, obtained by entirely different mechanisms.
