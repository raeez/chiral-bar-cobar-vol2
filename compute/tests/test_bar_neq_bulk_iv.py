Independent verification: BarTwc(A) is NOT bulkChirHoch(A) (voice-table row 2).

CLAUDE.md voice table forbids "BarTwc(A) is the bulk." The legitimate
identification is bulkOf(A) = bulkChirHoch(A); BarTwc(A) is the
twisting/coupling object, not the bulk.

Vol II (CLAUDE.md sec. 3): five objects never conflated --
  A_b = End_C(b), BarTwc(A_b), A^i = H^* BarTwc(A_b),
  A^!, Z^der_ch(A_b) = bulkChirHoch(A_b).

The construction Omega(BarTwc(A_b)) = A_b is INVERSION (Vol I bar/cobar
loop), not Koszul duality. The bulk is computed from chiral Hochschild
cohomology, NOT from the bar complex.

WITNESSES used here:
  (1) Heisenberg H_k (single generator J of weight 1)
  (2) Virasoro Vir_c (single generator T of weight 2)

For each witness we compute two integers that must DIFFER:
  - dim_k BarTwc(A) at small bar-filtration depth k
    (bar complex T^c(s^{-1} bar A) is cofree conilpotent)
  - dim_k Hoch^k(A) at the same homological degree
    (chiral Hochschild = exterior algebra on generators by Theorem H)

These dimensions disagree by orders of magnitude, witnessing the type
distinction Bar(A) != Z^der_ch(A) at the level of vector spaces.

DISJOINT ROUTE
--------------
The two integers come from CONSTRUCTIONS WITH DISJOINT INPUT:
  - Bar complex dim: cofree-coalgebra tensor power (combinatorial,
    Adams-Hilton / Stasheff bar construction predates chiral algebras);
  - Hoch^k dim: exterior algebra Lambda^k on n generators (binomial),
    computed via Vol II Theorem H Koszul = exterior identification.

Neither computation invokes the other; the binomial expression
binom(n, k) for Hoch^k is an algebraic finiteness statement on the
generator span, while the bar complex dimension counts symbol-strings
in a tensor coalgebra.

PRIMARY SOURCES

  combinatorics, predating chiral algebras).
