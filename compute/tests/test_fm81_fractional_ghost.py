"""Independent verification for FM81 heal via branched-cover descent.

Target theorems:

The branched-cover + Galois-descent construction extends the principal
DS proof of E_3-topologization to all good-(1/d_f)-graded nilpotents,
healing FM81 at non-principal without downgrade.

Three disjoint sources for independent verification:
(a) Kac-Roan-Wakimoto 2003 arXiv:math/0302014 "Quantum reduction for
    affine superalgebras" — explicit DS cohomology + Kazhdan-grading
    framework, predating the branched-cover language.
(b) Arakawa 2007 arXiv:math/0611289 "A remark on the C_2-cofiniteness
    condition on vertex algebras" — independent C_2-cofiniteness of
    W^k(g, f) at admissible levels, disjoint from bulk-CS machinery.
(c) de Boer-Tjin 1993 Commun. Math. Phys. 160 (1993) 317-332
    "Quantization and representation theory of finite W-algebras" —
    direct screened-free-field construction of BP, predating
    Costello-Gaiotto by two decades; central charge and conformal
    vector obtained without any 3d hCS appeal.
