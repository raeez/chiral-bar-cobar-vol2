# Borel Resurgence of the Shadow Tower: Investigation Report

## Summary

The shadow tower S_r has asymptotic behavior (Darboux transfer theorem):

    S_r ~ -A * rho^r * r^{-5/2} * cos(r*omega + phi)

where rho is the shadow growth rate, omega the oscillation frequency, A the
Darboux amplitude, and phi a computable phase. The minus sign comes from
Gamma(-1/2) = -2*sqrt(pi) in the Flajolet-Sedgewick transfer theorem.

This investigation examined the Borel resurgence structure of the shadow tower
across the Virasoro family, computing Borel singularity positions, Darboux
coefficients, Stokes graph geometry, and the (non-)connection to zeta zeros.

## Key Findings

### 1. Borel singularity positions

The Borel singularities (instanton actions) are at A_{+/-} = 1/t_{+/-} where
t_{+/-} are the zeros of the shadow metric Q_L(t). For all c > 0 with
Delta > 0, the singularities are complex conjugates in the LEFT HALF-PLANE:

| c     | A_+                     | |A_+| = rho | arg(A_+)/pi | convergent? |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1/2   | -12.000 - 3.614i        | 12.532      | -0.9069     | NO          |
| 1     | -6.000 - 1.721i         | 6.242       | -0.9111     | NO          |
| 2     | -3.000 - 0.791i         | 3.102       | -0.9180     | NO          |
| 4     | -1.500 - 0.345i         | 1.539       | -0.9280     | NO          |
| 6     | -1.000 - 0.207i         | 1.021       | -0.9351     | NO          |
| 13    | -6/13 - 0.074i          | 0.467       | -0.9496     | YES         |
| 25    | -0.240 - 0.030i         | 0.242       | -0.9611     | YES         |
| 26    | -3/13 - 0.028i          | 0.232       | -0.9617     | YES         |

The critical central charge c* ~ 6.1243 separates divergent (rho > 1) from
convergent (rho < 1) shadow towers.

### 2. Darboux coefficient structure

The singular amplitude at the branch point t_+ is:

    sigma = sqrt(-q2 * t_+ * (t_+ - t_-))

and the Darboux amplitude for the asymptotic formula is A = |sigma*t_+^2|/sqrt(pi).

Key observations:
- The Darboux amplitude grows rapidly with c: from 0.001 at c=1/2 to 133 at c=26
- The phase phi is small and slowly increasing: from 0.017*pi at c=1/2 to 0.154*pi at c=26
- The oscillation frequency omega = |arg(t_+)| is near pi for all c (the branch points
  are in the left half-plane near the negative real axis)
- The sign of the asymptotic formula includes a MINUS (from Gamma(-1/2) in the transfer
  theorem), verified numerically for r = 25..75 at c = 13

### 3. Self-dual point c = 13

At the Virasoro self-dual point (Vir_c^! = Vir_{26-c} = Vir_13):
- rho(13) = 0.4674 (convergent tower, R = 2.14)
- Branch points: t_{+/-} = -2.1127 +/- 0.3377i
- Borel singularities: A_{+/-} = -6/13 +/- 0.0738i
- Stokes direction: arg(A_+) = -0.9496*pi (nearly anti-podal)
- Enhanced Z_2 symmetry in the Stokes graph from Koszul self-duality
- kappa + kappa! = 13 (NOT zero; this is the Virasoro complementarity sum)

### 4. Stokes structure

The Stokes graph divides the t-plane into sectors by:
- Stokes lines at arg(t) = arg(A_{+/-}) (where Im(A/t) = 0)
- Anti-Stokes lines at arg(t) = arg(A_{+/-}) +/- pi/2

The leading Stokes constant is S_1 = +/- 2*pi*i, arising from the square-root
monodromy of sqrt(Q_L) around each simple zero. The shadow connection has
residue 1/2 at each zero of Q_L, giving monodromy exp(2*pi*i * 1/2) = -1
(the Koszul sign).

### 5. Median resummation

For divergent shadow towers (c < c*), the median resummation

    G^med(t) = (1/2)(S_+[G](t) + S_-[G](t))

provides a well-defined real-valued non-perturbative completion. Since the
shadow generating function G(t) = int_0^t s*sqrt(Q_L(s)) ds is known exactly
(algebraic functions + logarithms), the median resummation can be verified
against the exact answer wherever both are defined.

For convergent shadow towers (c > c*), the series already converges and no
resummation is needed. The Borel structure is still mathematically present but
physically irrelevant.

### 6. Connection to zeta zeros: NONE

**The shadow tower's Borel singularities have NO connection to Riemann zeta zeros.**

The reasons are structural:
1. The Borel singularities are at positions determined by the shadow metric Q_L,
   which depends on the OPE data (kappa, alpha, S_4). For rational c, these
   positions are ALGEBRAIC NUMBERS.
2. The zeta zeros are at s = 1/2 + i*gamma_n where gamma_n are TRANSCENDENTAL
   numbers (assuming standard conjectures).
3. There is no known mathematical mechanism connecting OPE-determined quadratic
   branch points to zeta zeros.
4. The numerical ratios |Im(A_+)|/gamma_1 are irrational and do not simplify.

There is an interesting STRUCTURAL PARALLEL in that both systems involve:
- A functional equation (c <-> 26-c for shadows, s <-> 1-s for zeta)
- A self-dual point (c = 13, s = 1/2)
- Resurgent asymptotic expansions
- A spectral zeta function (the constrained Epstein for shadows)

This parallel is STRUCTURAL (both involve spectral zeta functions with
functional equations) but NOT a mathematical identity. The constrained Epstein
zeta function for Q_L and the Riemann zeta function are DIFFERENT objects with
DIFFERENT singularity structures.

### 7. Constrained Epstein connection

The Borel singularities of the shadow tower and the spectral data of the
constrained Epstein zeta function Z(s; Q_L) are controlled by the SAME
algebraic curve: the zeros of Q_L(t). The discontinuity across the Borel cut
at A_+ encodes the monodromy of sqrt(Q_L), which is the same monodromy that
controls the functional equation of Z(s; Q_L).

This is the genuine "real-to-complex bridge": the shadow tower (real, perturbative)
and the Epstein spectral data (complex, non-perturbative) are two facets of the
same underlying algebraic curve.

### 8. Koszul duality in the Borel plane

Under Koszul duality c <-> 26-c:
- kappa(c) + kappa(26-c) = 13 (always)
- rho(c) != rho(26-c) in general (the formula depends on c^2)
- rho(c) = rho(26-c) only at c = 13 (self-dual fixed point)
- The Borel singularities A_+(c) and A_+(26-c) are at DIFFERENT positions
- The Stokes graphs at c and 26-c have different geometries

The asymmetry of rho under duality is a consequence of the c^2 in the
denominator of rho^2 = (180c+872)/((5c+22)*c^2). This breaks the c <-> 26-c
symmetry everywhere except at the fixed point c = 13.

## Mathematical conclusions

1. The shadow tower's Borel resurgence is FULLY DETERMINED by the shadow metric
   Q_L(t). The singularity structure is algebraic (branch points of sqrt(Q_L)),
   and the Stokes constants are controlled by the monodromy (-1, the Koszul sign).

2. The "real-to-complex bridge" is NOT a connection to zeta zeros. It is the
   connection between the perturbative shadow tower (real coefficients S_r) and
   the spectral data of the constrained Epstein function (complex analytic
   continuation), both controlled by the same quadratic form Q_L.

3. The Darboux transfer theorem with the correct sign (minus from Gamma(-1/2))
   accurately predicts the shadow coefficients at high arity, with ratio S_r/pred
   converging to 1 as r -> infinity.

4. The Koszul involution c <-> 26-c does NOT preserve rho (except at the fixed
   point c = 13). The Borel singularity positions are asymmetric under duality.
