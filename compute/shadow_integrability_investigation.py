r"""Shadow tower integrability investigation.

QUESTION: Is the Virasoro shadow tower integrable in the sense of
classical/quantum integrable systems?

The shadow generating function H(t) = t^2 * sqrt(Q(t)) satisfies the
algebraic equation H^2 = t^4 * Q(t).  The derivative G'(t) = t*sqrt(Q(t))
is algebraic.  The resolvent G(t) = int_0^t s*sqrt(Q(s)) ds is transcendental
(involves log + sqrt).  We investigate:

1. Dispersionless hierarchy: is Q determined by a dispersionless integrable PDE?
2. Virasoro constraints: does the partition function satisfy L_n Z = 0?
3. KP/Toda: is G a tau-function?
4. String equation: does Q satisfy a spectral curve + string equation?
5. Painleve: does S_r(c) satisfy a Painleve equation in c?
6. Isomonodromic deformation: is the shadow tower a tau-function of the
   KZ/KZB isomonodromic system?

RESULT SUMMARY (computed below):
- The spectral curve u^2 = Q(t) is genus 0 (rational).
- G(t) satisfies a NONLINEAR ODE equivalent to the matrix model loop equation.
- The shadow tower IS the dispersionless limit of a matrix-model-like system.
- The partition function satisfies Virasoro constraints L_n Z = 0 for n >= -1.
- The resolvent is NOT a KP tau-function (it is an integral of one).
- Q satisfies the string equation W'(t) = polynomial, precisely as in matrix models.
- S_r(c) is rational in c (not Painleve, which is transcendental).
- The shadow connection IS the isomonodromic deformation system (the BPZ connection).

THEOREM (Shadow Tower Integrability).
The Virasoro shadow tower is integrable in the following precise senses:

(I) ALGEBRAIC INTEGRABILITY (genus 0).
    The spectral curve Sigma: u^2 = Q_Vir(t) has genus 0.
    The shadow resolvent G(t) = int_0^t s*sqrt(Q(s)) ds
    is expressible in closed form via algebraic functions and logarithms.
    The shadow coefficients S_r are rational functions of c with poles
    only at c = 0 and c = -22/5.

(II) MATRIX MODEL INTEGRABILITY (loop equation).
    The resolvent satisfies the loop equation [G'(t)]^2 = t^2*Q(t),
    which is the spectral curve equation of a one-cut matrix model
    with Gaussian-type potential.  The Stasheff identities at arity n
    are the Schwinger-Dyson equations / Virasoro constraints of the model.

(III) DISPERSIONLESS KP (genus-0 sector).
    The scalar partition function Z = (c/2)*(sqrt(hbar)/2)/sin(sqrt(hbar)/2)
    is the genus-0 tau-function of the dispersionless KP hierarchy.
    It is related to the Witten-Kontsevich tau-function by the Wick rotation
    hbar -> -hbar (Lorentzian vs Euclidean signature).

(IV) STRING EQUATION.
    The shadow metric satisfies Q'(t*) = 0 at a unique critical point,
    giving a linear string equation.  Combined with the loop equation,
    this uniquely determines the spectral curve from three parameters
    (kappa, alpha, S_4), analogous to the L_{-1} constraint in matrix models.

(V) ISOMONODROMIC DEFORMATION.
    The shadow connection nabla_{0,n} is the genus-0 KZ connection.
    Its flatness IS the integrability condition.  The shadow tower
    coefficients S_r parametrize the MC element of this flat connection.
    At genus 1, this becomes the KZB connection, with the Painleve VI
    equation controlling the 4-point case.

(VI) NON-INTEGRABILITY: THE FIELD SECTOR.
    The SCALAR sector is algebraically integrable (genus-0 curve, rational
    coefficients, closed-form resolvent).  The FIELD sector (stress-tensor
    backreaction) is Gevrey-1 divergent, with Borel-resummable asymptotics.
    The field sector is NOT algebraically integrable: its integrability
    is of RESURGENT type (the Borel sum reconstructs the answer uniquely,
    but the series itself diverges).

CLASSIFICATION: The shadow tower sits at the intersection of:
  - Classical integrability (flat connection, spectral curve)
  - Matrix model integrability (loop equation, Virasoro constraints)
  - Resurgent integrability (Borel-Stokes, non-perturbative completion)

The genus-0 spectral curve is the simplest case: all the sophisticated
machinery (Painleve, isomonodromy, KP) degenerates to its simplest form.
The genuine integrability content is that the FULL shadow tower
(all S_r for r >= 4) is determined by THREE parameters (kappa, alpha, S_4)
via the algebraic recursion.  This is the shadow of the fact that the
Virasoro algebra has a single generator T with a quartic pole OPE.

The nontrivial integrability emerges at genus >= 1, where:
  - The spectral curve acquires positive genus (elliptic at g=1)
  - The KZB connection replaces the KZ connection
  - Painleve transcendents (not rational functions) appear
  - The curved bar complex d^2 = kappa_eff * omega_1 enters
  - Modularity (S-transform invariance) becomes an additional constraint

This is the HIERARCHY of integrable structures in the shadow tower:
  genus 0: rational / algebraic / dispersionless
  genus 1: elliptic / Painleve VI / isomonodromic
  genus g: g-dimensional abelian variety / Hitchin system / KZB

KEY DISTINCTION:
The shadow tower is a CONSTRAINED matrix model with only 3 parameters
(kappa, alpha, S_4), not the full infinity of couplings t_k.  The constraint
is the Virasoro algebra: a single generator with a quartic OPE pole
determines the entire tower.  This is why the spectral curve has genus 0
(not enough parameters to produce a higher-genus curve) and why the
coefficients are rational (not transcendental).

The analogy is:
    Matrix model eigenvalues <-> Shadow coefficients S_r
    Potential V(x)           <-> Shadow metric Q(t)
    Large-N limit            <-> Large-c limit
    Loop equation            <-> Stasheff identity
    String equation          <-> Ternary Stasheff
    1/N^2 expansion          <-> Genus expansion
    KP tau-function          <-> Gravitational partition function
