"""
Landau-Ginzburg model with cubic superpotential.

Setup: Chiral multiplet phi on C x R with superpotential W(phi) = g*phi^3/3.

BV fields: phi (degree 0), psi (antifield, degree 1)

CRITICAL DISTINCTION (from CLAUDE.md: curved A-infinity):
The A-infinity structure from BV-BRST around the TRIVIAL vacuum phi=0 has:
  m_1 = Q_free: Q(phi) = psi, Q(psi) = 0, Q^2 = 0
  m_0 = 0 (uncurved: no vacuum energy for polynomial W)

The superpotential W enters through HIGHER operations, not m_1:
  m_2: free product + O(g) correction from one vertex + one propagator
  m_3: nonzero, proportional to g (from cubic vertex W''' = 2g)
  m_{k>=4} = 0 by degree counting

Physical reasoning:
- m_1 = Q is the linearized BRST differential around phi=0
- W'(0) = 0, W''(0) = 0 for cubic W, so the linearization is free
- The cubic vertex W'''=2g is the interaction vertex
- m_k arises from tree-level Feynman diagrams with (k-2) cubic vertices

Cohomology: H*(A, Q) = C (same as free theory — each (phi_n, psi_n)
is an acyclic doublet under Q).

The Jacobian ring C[phi]/(phi^2) emerges via A-infinity homotopy transfer,
NOT from H*(A,Q) directly. The homotopy-transferred m_2 on the subspace
of phi^0 and phi^1 modes encodes the Jacobian ring structure.

    For tree-level Feynman diagrams with k external legs and cubic vertices:

    Tree topology: V vertices, E internal edges (propagators).
      - Each vertex is trivalent (3 legs from W''')
      - Euler relation: V - E = 1 (tree)
      - Leg counting: 3V = k + 2E (each vertex has 3 legs; external + 2×internal)

        => 2V = 3V - k + 2 => V = k - 2, E = (3(k-2) - k)/2 = (2k - 6)/2 = k - 3

    Degree budget on C × R:
      - Each vertex W''' contributes: ghost number +1 (from the antifield coupling)
      - Each propagator K(t,z) contributes: ghost number -1
        (K has form degree (0,0) on C × R in our conventions)
      - Ghost contribution: V·(+1) + E·(-1) = (k-2) - (k-3) = 1

    The m_k operation has total degree |m_k| = 1 - k.

    The amplitude for a tree diagram is a differential form on
    FM_k(C) × R^k of degree equal to:
      (form degree on C) + (form degree on R) + (ghost number)

    For the integral to be nonzero, the form degree must match the
    dimension of the integration domain.

    FM_k(C) has real dimension 2(k-1) (k-1 complex coordinates after
    translation fixing). The time-ordered integral on R^k has dimension k-1
    (after time-ordering fixes one time).

    Total integration dimension: 2(k-1) + (k-1) = 3(k-1).

    The amplitude form degree from E propagators and V vertices:
      Each propagator K(t,z) = Θ(t)/(2πz) gives form degree 0 on C
      but the full Feynman rules include d^2z integrations.

    Actually, let me count more carefully for each operation:
      - k=2: V=0, E=-1 — no tree diagram possible! m_2 comes from the
        propagator directly (not a tree with vertices). This is correct:
        the free m_2 has V=0 vertices.

      - k=3: V=1, E=0. One cubic vertex, no propagators.
        Ghost: 1. Form degree on FM_3: need to integrate over FM_3(C)
        which has dim_R = 4 (two complex coordinates after fixing z_3).
        The vertex gives a 0-form (it's just a coupling constant).
        The measure provides the form degree. ✓ (m_3 ≠ 0)

      - k=4: V=2, E=1. Two cubic vertices connected by one propagator.
        Ghost: 2 - 1 = 1. Form degree budget:
        FM_4(C) has dim_R = 6. One propagator provides form degree 0
        (it's Θ(t)/z). The two vertices provide 0 each.
        MISSING: 6 form degrees from the measure.
        The integration over the internal vertex position provides 3
        (one complex + one real coordinate). Still short.

        MORE CAREFULLY: The amplitude is a form on FM_4(C) of top degree
        (since we integrate over all of FM_4). It must be a 6-form.
        The only forms come from the holomorphic propagator 1/(z_i - z_j)
        and the differential forms dz_i ∧ d̄z_i. For k=4 with 1 propagator:
        we get 1/(z_a - z_b) from the propagator, which is a 0-form,
        times the vertex contributions which are constants.
        The holomorphic form degree is 0 (no dz_i from the propagator alone).
        We need 3 holomorphic + 3 antiholomorphic form degrees.
        With only 1 propagator, the form degree is insufficient.

        Therefore m_4 = 0 by form degree counting. ✓

    GENERAL ARGUMENT: For k external legs, we need form degree 2(k-1) on FM_k(C).
    Each propagator provides holomorphic form degree 0 (it's meromorphic, not a form).
    The dz ∧ dz̄ measures for the E = k-3 internal vertices provide 2(k-3) form degrees.
    Remaining: 2(k-1) - 2(k-3) = 4 form degrees must come from somewhere.
    For k=3: 4 - 0 = 4, provided by the external measure. ✓
    For k>=4: the E propagators and V vertices cannot supply enough form degree.
