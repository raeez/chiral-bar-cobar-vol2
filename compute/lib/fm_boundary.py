Fulton-MacPherson compactification: boundary strata and Stokes' theorem.

FM_k(X) is the compactification of Conf_k(X) (configuration space of
k labeled points on X). For X = C (complex plane):

  dim_R FM_k(C) = 2(k-1)  (after fixing translation)

Boundary strata correspond to subsets S ⊂ {1,...,k} with |S| ≥ 2:
  D_S ≅ FM_{|S|}(T_x C) × FM_{k-|S|+1}(C)

The codimension of D_S is 2(|S|-1) - 2 = 2|S| - 4... NO, that's wrong.
Actually D_S has codimension 2(|S|-1) - (2|S|-2) = 0... also wrong.

Let me think carefully. FM_k(C) has real dimension 2(k-1) (k complex
coordinates minus one translation). The stratum D_S where the |S| points
collide has:
  FM_{|S|} (fiber, relative positions) × FM_{k-|S|+1}(C) (base)
  dim = 2(|S|-1) + 2(k-|S|+1-1) = 2|S|-2 + 2k-2|S| = 2k-2 = 2(k-1)

So D_S has the SAME dimension as FM_k(C)? No — D_S is a boundary stratum,
which is codimension 1 in the BOUNDARY. More precisely:

For the manifold-with-corners structure:
  D_S is a codimension-1 boundary face when |S| = 2 (simple collision).
  D_S with |S| ≥ 3 gives higher-codimension strata.

CORRECTION: The codimension-1 boundary strata of FM_k(C) are
D_S for ALL subsets S with |S| ≥ 2 (not just |S|=2). Each D_S
is codimension 1 in the boundary. The key is that the normal direction
to D_S is the SCALE parameter for the colliding cluster.

For the A-infinity identity via Stokes' theorem:
  0 = ∫_{FM_k} dω = Σ_{|S|≥2} ±∫_{D_S} ω|_{D_S}

The sign ± comes from the orientation of D_S in ∂FM_k.
