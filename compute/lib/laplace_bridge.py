"""
Laplace transform bridge between λ-bracket and classical r-matrix.

The bridge relation (BR3 in the paper):
  r(z) = Res_{λ=0} e^{-λz} {a_λ b}

For POLYNOMIAL λ-brackets, this is a finite sum using:
  ∫_0^∞ λ^n e^{-λz} dλ = n! / z^{n+1}   (Re(z) > 0)

So if {a_λ b} = Σ_{n≥0} c_n λ^n, then:
  r(z) = Σ_{n≥0} c_n · n! / z^{n+1}

Conversely, given an OPE a(z)b(w) ~ Σ c_n / (z-w)^{n+1}:
  n-products: a_n b = c_n
  λ-bracket: {a_λ b} = Σ c_n λ^n / n!

The Laplace bridge connects the z-space (OPE/r-matrix) and
λ-space (λ-bracket) descriptions.
