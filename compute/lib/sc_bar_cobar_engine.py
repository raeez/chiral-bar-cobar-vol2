"""Bar-Cobar and Derived Center Engine: chain-level computations.

The bar complex B(A) is an E_1 chiral coassociative coalgebra:
  - bar differential d_B from OPE residues on FM_k(C) (chiral product)
  - deconcatenation coproduct Delta from Conf_k(R) (topological)

NOTE (AP165): B(A) is NOT an SC^{ch,top}-coalgebra. The SC^{ch,top}
structure emerges in the chiral derived center: the pair
(C^bullet_ch(A,A), A) is the SC datum, with bulk (chiral Hochschild
cochains, defined via End^{ch}_A) acting on boundary (A) via braces.

The key mathematical objects:

1. **E_1 bar complex**: For a chiral algebra A, the bar complex
   B(A) = T^c(s^{-1} A-bar) has:
   - Underlying space: s^{-1}A^{otimes k} (desuspended inputs)
   - Differential d_B: coderivation from A_infinity operations
   - Coproduct Delta: deconcatenation (E_1 coassociative)

2. **Curved A_infinity at genus g >= 1**: d^2_fib = kappa * omega_g
   where kappa = modular Koszul curvature and omega_g is the genus-g
   Hodge class (E_2(tau) at genus 1).

3. **Chiral derived center**: C^bullet_ch(A,A) from chiral
   endomorphism operad; the pair (C^bullet_ch(A,A), A) carries
   SC^{ch,top} structure via brace operations.

4. **Homotopy-Koszulity verification**: thm:homotopy-Koszul states
   SC^{ch,top} is homotopy-Koszul. This means the bar/cobar adjunction
   is a Quillen equivalence. We verify this at small arities by computing
   the bar complex and checking concentration in degree 0.
