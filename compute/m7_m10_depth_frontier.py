r"""Extend Virasoro A∞ depth spectra to arities 7-10 via numerical Stasheff recursion.

Strategy: Full symbolic computation at arity 7 is prohibitively expensive (tracking
d5T and higher, with hundreds of composition terms). Instead, we use a NUMERICAL
engine at specific c values and many random spectral parameter samples to:

  (a) Extract depth spectra (which derivative orders are populated)
  (b) Compute scalar (shadow) coefficients S_k
  (c) Compute L^1 norms for Gevrey-1 analysis
  (d) Test for secondary vanishing (n=4 anomaly pattern at n=8?)
  (e) Test palindrome factorization patterns

The numerical engine represents m_k(T,...,T; λ₁,...,λ_{k-1}) as a dictionary
{derivative_order: polynomial_coefficient} where the coefficient is a NUMBER
(for fixed spectral parameters and c).

Depth spectrum extraction: run at many random λ values and record which
derivative orders are nonzero. A depth d is populated if the coefficient of
∂^{k-2-d}T (weight w = k-2-d, depth d = k-1-w) is generically nonzero.

By the weight-depth identity: w + d = k-1, so field ∂^w T has depth d = k-1-w.
The scalar contact term has depth k+1.

        """Compute the outer spectral parameters after inner m_j insertion at position s.

        The inner block takes positions [s, s+j-1].
        Inner params: lam_list[s:s+j-1] (between inputs s and s+j-1).
        After contraction: the inner block becomes a single node.

        The outer params are formed by:
        - params before the block: lam_list[0:s] (unchanged, s params)
          Wait, not s params. The params between positions 0..s-1 are
          lam_list[0:s-1], giving s-1 params.
          BUT position s-1 is adjacent to the block start, so lam_list[s-1]
          is the param between position s-1 and position s (= start of block).
          After contraction, this becomes the param between position s-1 and
          the inner output. So it survives as-is.

        Actually, the convention from the arity-5/6 code is:
        - The gap between the inner output and the next input after the block
          absorbs the sum of the inner params plus the boundary param.

        Let me follow the pattern from the existing code:
        - For inner at position s taking j inputs with inner params lam_list[s:s+j-1]:
          - Params before: lam_list[0:s]  (these are params between positions 0..s-1 and s)
            Actually wait: lam_list[0] is between position 0 and 1, etc.
            lam_list[p] is between position p and p+1.
          - The inner block spans positions s to s+j-1.
          - Internal params (consumed): lam_list[s] to lam_list[s+j-2]
            (params between consecutive inputs within the block)
          - After contraction: the block becomes a single position.
          - The params in the merged sequence:
            * lam_list[0] through lam_list[s-2]: between original positions before block (s-1 params)
            * If s > 0: lam_list[s-1] is between position s-1 and the block start
              After contraction: between position s-1 and the inner output. Survives.
            * The MERGED param between inner output and next position after block:
              Sum of consumed params + boundary.
              From the arity-5 code pattern:
              C0: inner at pos 0-2, outer params [l1+l2+l3, l4]
                merged param = l1+l2+l3 = sum(lam_list[0:3])
              C1: inner at pos 1-3, outer params [l1, l2+l3+l4]
                merged param = l2+l3+l4 = sum(lam_list[1:4])

              So the merged param at the position of the inner output is:
              sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1]) = sum of all params from start of block to
              one past the end of the block.
              Wait: for C0 with j=3 inner, sum(lam_list[0:3]) = l1+l2+l3,
              but lam_list[0:3] = [l1,l2,l3]. The inner only consumed l1,l2
              (j-1=2 params). The extra l3 is the boundary param after the block.

              So: merged param = sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1]) when s+j-1 < k-1
                  (i.e., when the block doesn't end at the rightmost position).
              When the block IS rightmost: no param after the block. The merged
              param is just sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1]).

              Actually let me re-examine. For C2 in arity-5: inner at pos 2-4
              (j=3, s=2), outer params [l1, l2]. Here:
              lam_list[2:4] = [l3,l4], sum = l3+l4.
              But the outer params are [l1, l2], NOT [l1, l2, l3+l4].
              Because the inner output is in the RIGHTMOST slot of the outer m3,
              there's no param after it.

              OK so the pattern is:
              Build outer params from left to right:
              1. All params strictly before the block: lam_list[0:s-1] if s > 0 -> s-1 params
                 Wait no: lam_list[0] through lam_list[s-2] gives s-1 params.
                 But if s=1, that's lam_list[0:0] = [] (0 params before).
                 Hmm, for C1 (s=1, j=3), outer params = [l1, ...].
                 l1 = lam_list[0], which is between pos 0 and pos 1 = start of block.
                 After contraction: between pos 0 and inner output. So it survives.

              Let me think of it as: after contraction, the i outer inputs are at
              positions [0, ..., s-1, OUTPUT, s+j, ..., k-1].
              The outer spectral params are between consecutive outer positions:
              - Between outer pos p and p+1 (for p = 0, ..., i-2):
                If neither p nor p+1 is the OUTPUT position:
                  the param is the original lam_list[original_pos_of(p)].
                If p+1 = OUTPUT position: the param is lam_list[s-1] (the original
                  param between position s-1 and position s).
                If p = OUTPUT position: the param is sum of lam_list[s:s+j-1]
                  (params from start of block up to but not including the param
                  between block end and next position). Wait, that would be
                  sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1]) = sum of j-1 internal params.
                  But for C0 in arity-5: output at slot 0, sum should be...
                  After contraction: [OUTPUT, 3, 4]. Param between OUTPUT and 3
                  is the combined param spanning from block-start(0) to 3.
                  Original params in that span: lam_list[0], lam_list[1], lam_list[2]
                  = l1, l2, l3. Sum = l1+l2+l3. But internal params are only
                  lam_list[0], lam_list[1] (j-1=2 params). The extra lam_list[2]=l3
                  is the param between pos 2 (block end) and pos 3 (first after block).

                  So: param between OUTPUT and first-after-block =
                  sum(internal params) + boundary_after = sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1]).

                  For s=0, j=3: sum(lam_list[0:3]) = l1+l2+l3. Here s+j-1 = 2,
                  so lam_list[0:3] actually is lam_list[0], lam_list[1], lam_list[2].
                  That's 3 params, which is j=3 params... but j-1=2 internal params.
                  Wait: lam_list[s:s+j-1] = lam_list[0:2] = [l1, l2] (2 params).
                  sum = l1+l2 != l1+l2+l3.

                  Hmm, there's an off-by-one. Let me recount.
                  For C0: outer params = [l1+l2+l3, l4] from the existing code.
                  Inner at positions 0,1,2 (j=3 inputs, s=0).
                  Boundary between block-end (pos 2) and first-after (pos 3) = lam_list[2] = l3.
                  Internal params: lam_list[0]=l1, lam_list[1]=l2 (j-1=2 params).
                  So merged param = l1 + l2 + l3 = sum(internal) + boundary = sum(lam_list[s:s+j]).
                  That's lam_list[0:3] = [l1,l2,l3], sum = l1+l2+l3.

                  For C2: inner at positions 2,3,4 (j=3, s=2). Output is rightmost.
                  Internal params: lam_list[2]=l3, lam_list[3]=l4 (j-1=2 params).
                  No boundary after (block ends at last position).
                  So there is no merged param on the right. Outer params = [l1, l2].
                  Before-block params: lam_list[0]=l1, lam_list[1]=l2 (s-1=1 params
                  between positions before block, but wait s=2, so positions before
                  block are 0,1. Params between them: lam_list[0]=l1. Plus param
                  between pos 1 and block start (pos 2): lam_list[1]=l2.
                  Total: [l1, l2]. Correct!

        OK so the general rule:
        Outer params = params_before + [merged_param] + params_after
        where:
          params_before = lam_list[0:s-1] if s >= 1, else []
            Wait: lam_list[0:s-1] gives params from slot 0 to slot s-2.
            But we also need the param between position s-1 and the block start.
            Hmm no: if s=2, params_before should be [l1, l2]:
            l1 between pos 0 and 1, l2 between pos 1 and 2=block start.
            That's lam_list[0:2] = [l1, l2] = lam_list[0:s]. So s params.
            But wait: for s=0 there are no params before.
            lam_list[0:0] = []. Correct.
            For s=1: lam_list[0:1] = [l1]. That's the param between pos 0
            and pos 1 = block start. After contraction: between pos 0 and OUTPUT.
            Correct.

          Actually: params_before = lam_list[0:s] gives s params... but that
          CAN'T be right because if s > 0, lam_list[s-1] is the param between
          position s-1 and position s = block start. After contraction, this
          becomes the param between position s-1 and OUTPUT. It does survive.
          And lam_list[0:s] = [lam_list[0], ..., lam_list[s-1]].
          For C1 (s=1): lam_list[0:1] = [l1]. Outer params = [l1, merged].
          merged = sum(lam_list[1:4]) = l2+l3+l4. Outer = [l1, l2+l3+l4]. Correct!

          For C0 (s=0): lam_list[0:0] = []. Outer params = [merged, ...].
          merged = sum(lam_list[0:3]) = l1+l2+l3. params_after = lam_list[3:4] = [l4].
          Outer = [l1+l2+l3, l4]. Correct!

          For C2 (s=2): lam_list[0:2] = [l1, l2]. No merged param (block is rightmost).
          Outer = [l1, l2]. Correct!

        So: params_before = list(lam_list[0:s])  (s items, can be empty)
            merged_param = sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1])  if s+j-1 < k-1 (not rightmost)
            Wait: s+j-1 is the index of the last inner position.
            The block spans positions s to s+j-1.
            If s+j-1 < k-1 (not the last position), then there's a param after:
            lam_list[s+j-1] between block-end and first-after.
            merged_param = sum(lam_list[s:s+j])... no.

            Let me just directly compute:
            merged_param = sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1])  -- this gives internal params
            PLUS the boundary: if s+j <= k-1, add lam_list[s+j-1].
            Hmm, for C0: s=0, j=3: sum(lam_list[0:2]) = l1+l2, boundary = lam_list[2]=l3.
            Total = l1+l2+l3. But sum(lam_list[0:3]) = l1+l2+l3 directly.

            So merged_param = sum(lam_list[s:s+j-1+1]) = sum(lam_list[s:s+j])
            when the block is not rightmost?
            s+j-1 < k-1 means s+j < k, so s+j <= k-1, and lam_list has k-1 entries.
            lam_list[s:s+j] is valid (j entries).

            For C0: lam_list[0:3] = [l1,l2,l3]. Sum = l1+l2+l3. Correct!
            For C1: lam_list[1:4] = [l2,l3,l4]. Sum = l2+l3+l4. Correct!

            When the block IS rightmost (s+j-1 = k-1, i.e. s+j = k):
            No merged param needed (output is at the rightmost slot of outer).
            Just: params_before = lam_list[0:s].

            params_after = lam_list[s+j:k-1] if s+j < k-1 else []
            (params after the merged gap)
