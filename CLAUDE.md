# CLAUDE.md — Volume II: A∞ Chiral Algebras and 3D Holomorphic-Topological QFT

## What the Engine Computes

Volume I built the categorical logarithm — the bar construction B(A) for chiral algebras on curves, with five theorems proving its existence, invertibility, branch structure, leading coefficient, and coefficient ring. Volume II reads the output in three dimensions.

The bar complex carries two structures: a **differential** d_B from OPE residues on FM_k(ℂ), encoding the holomorphic chiral product, and a **coproduct** Δ from ordered deconcatenation on Conf_k(ℝ), encoding the topological interval-cutting. The differential lives in the ℂ-direction; the coproduct lives in the ℝ-direction. Together, a bar element of degree k is parametrized by FM_k(ℂ) × Conf_k(ℝ) — the product of holomorphic and topological configuration spaces.

This product is the operadic fingerprint of a 3d holomorphic-topological QFT on ℂ_z × ℝ_t, where observables factorize holomorphically in z and associatively in t. The two-colored Swiss-cheese operad SC^{ch,top} has operation spaces FM_k(ℂ) × E₁(m). The bar differential is the closed (holomorphic) color. The bar coproduct is the open (topological) color. The no-open-to-closed rule reflects that bulk interactions restrict to boundaries but not conversely. **The bar complex presents the Swiss-cheese algebra, as the Steinberg variety presents the Hecke algebra.**

At genus g ≥ 1: curved Swiss-cheese with curvature κ(A)·ω_g from the Hodge bundle. The non-vanishing of higher A∞ operations IS the curved bar structure d² = κ(A)·ω₁ — formality fails precisely because the logarithm acquires monodromy.

## The Monograph

Two volumes by Raeez Lorgat. Vol I (~1,960pp, ~/chiral-bar-cobar) proves the machine. Vol II (~450pp, this repo) shows what it computes and how to read the output.

Every theorem proved, every physical identification precise, every construction functorial. When claims outrun proofs, strengthen the proof first. Target: Annals/Astérisque grade.

## Vol I Theorems Used Here

Every chapter depends on Vol I's five theorems. Cross-references to Vol I labels resolve as "undefined" — expected for a multi-volume work.

| Vol I Theorem | What it supplies to Vol II |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **(A)** Bar-cobar adjunction | The bar complex exists as a factorization coalgebra; reinterpreted as SC^{ch,top}-algebra structure — the bridge theorem |
| **(B)** Koszul inversion | Bar-cobar equivalence on the Koszul locus; lifted to raviolo VA setting and completed towers |
| **(C)** Complementarity | Genus-g obstructions decompose as complementary Lagrangians; the bulk-boundary-line triangle inherits this (−1)-shifted symplectic structure |
| **(D)** Leading coefficient | Curvature κ(A)·ω_g governs the genus tower; curved Swiss-cheese = Swiss-cheese + Hodge deformation |
| **(H)** Hochschild ring | BV-BRST origin of the deformation ring; bulk ≃ chiral Hochschild (Theorem H gets its physical explanation) |

## Nine Parts (Treatise Architecture)

**I. From the Bar Complex to the Swiss-Cheese Operad.** The bridge from Vol I to three dimensions. SC^{ch,top} constructed, recognition theorem, homotopy-Koszulity proved. Raviolo descent: SC-algebra → raviolo VA → PVA on cohomology. Axiomatics: sesquilinearity, A∞ relations, cluster factorization.

**II. The Descent Calculus.** Two descent mechanisms: cohomological (bar → PVA via Arnold/Stokes) and genus (curved bar over M̄_g). FM calculus and PVA descent.

**III. The Bulk-Boundary-Line Core.** Chiral Hochschild, brace algebra, bar-cobar review, line operators, spectral braiding (proved core), Koszul triangle (proved core), celestial boundary transfer (proved core), physical origins (merged chapter).

**IV. The Standard HT Landscape.** Worked examples: Rosetta stone, free multiplet, LG, CS (proved), W-algebras (stable framework).

**V. Quantization and Obstruction Theory.** Modular PVA quantization (core), affine half-space BV, planted-forest L∞, 3d gravity.

**VI. The Ordered/Open Sector and Transport.** Ordered associative chiral KD (core), dg-shifted factorization bridge. The E₁ wing as equal partner.

**VII. Holographic and Celestial Frontier.** YM synthesis (core), celestial holography (core), logarithmic HT monodromy (core), anomaly-completed holography (core).

**VIII. Extensions, Conditional Results, and Frontier.** All frontier/conjectural material from splits. No earlier part depends on this part.

**IX. Conclusion and Aftermatter.** Conclusion, appendices (brace signs, orientations, FM proofs, PVA expanded).

## Standing Hypotheses — MADE EXPLICIT

**The algebraic framework is unconditional.** The former standing hypotheses (H1)–(H4) are no longer background axioms. They have been made explicit: (H1)–(H2) are now conditions of the physics bridge theorem (Theorem thm:physics-bridge), (H3) is a theorem, and (H4) is the recognition theorem. The pure-algebraic theory requires only a single definition:

**Definition (Logarithmic SC^{ch,top}-algebra, Definition def:log-SC-algebra):** A C_*(W(SC^{ch,top}))-algebra whose closed-colour A∞ operations are defined by logarithmic weight forms factoring as ω_k = ω_k^hol ⊗ ω_k^top on FM_k(ℂ) × Conf_k(ℝ).

The former axioms are now derived:

| | Content | New Status |
|---|---------|--------|
| (H1) | BV data, one-loop finiteness | Condition of the bridge theorem (Theorem thm:physics-bridge) — applies only to physical realisations |
| (H2) | Propagator: meromorphic in ℂ, exponential decay in ℝ | Consequence of Q = ∂̄ + d_t splitting — Green's function is Cauchy kernel × Heaviside |
| (H3) | FM compactification, logarithmic forms, AOS relations, Stokes exactness | Theorem of configuration space geometry (Theorem thm:FM-calculus) |
| (H4) | Factorization compatibility with C_*(W(SC^{ch,top})) | Recognition theorem (Theorem thm:recognition-SC) — already proved |

All results in Parts I–VII hold unconditionally for any logarithmic SC^{ch,top}-algebra. Physical theories (gauge theories satisfying Theorem thm:physics-bridge) provide the standard class of examples.

## Beilinson Rectification Loop

The full loop protocol is defined in Vol I's CLAUDE.md (`~/chiral-bar-cobar/CLAUDE.md`, section "Beilinson Rectification Loop — Chapter-Level Protocol"). It uses parallel Agent dispatch (RED/BLUE/GREEN audit), TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for persistent state, worktree isolation for speculative reconstitution, and build-gated fixing. Run `run the Beilinson loop on [TARGET]` to invoke on any Vol II chapter.

## Critical Pitfalls

**Inherited from Vol I (NEVER VIOLATE):**
- Four objects: A (algebra), B(A) (bar coalgebra), A^i (dual coalgebra), A^! (dual algebra). NEVER conflate.
- Ω(B(A)) = A is inversion. A^! via Verdier duality. Cobar does NOT produce A^!.
- COHOMOLOGICAL grading (|d| = +1). Bar uses DESUSPENSION. m₁²(a) = [m₀, a] (commutator, MINUS sign). Bar d² = 0 always.
- Sugawara UNDEFINED at critical level k = −h∨ (not "c diverges"). Feigin-Frenkel: k ↔ −k−2h∨.
- Virasoro self-dual at c = 13, NOT c = 26. Vir_c^! = Vir_{26−c}.

**Specific to Vol II:**
- Swiss-cheese **directionality is strict**: open-to-closed is EMPTY. No open inputs produce closed outputs. This is the mathematical expression of bulk→boundary directionality.
- PVA on cohomology H•(A,Q) is **(−1)-shifted**: the λ-bracket has shifted parity relative to classical PVA conventions.
- The R-matrix R(z) comes from **bulk-boundary composition**, NOT from the universal R-matrix of a quantum group (though they agree on the evaluation locus — this is DK-0).
- Formality fails at d' = 1: this is NOT a defect. The non-vanishing of higher A∞ operations IS the curved bar structure d² = κ(A)·ω₁ from Vol I.
- The corrected bulk/boundary/line triangle: **bulk ≃ derived CENTER of boundary**, NOT bulk = boundary. **Scope:** Proved rigorously in the boundary-linear exact sector (Theorem thm:boundary-linear-bulk-boundary). The global triangle for all HT theories is conjectural — it reduces formally to hypotheses (compact generator, derived center quasi-isomorphism) that are verified only in the boundary-linear case and for inputs from CDG20/GKW24.
- Chiral Koszulness from physics: **RESOLVED for the affine lineage** by the loop-order criterion (Theorem thm:one-loop-koszul), which shows one-loop exactness of the BV-BRST differential implies Koszulness. DS reduction (Theorem thm:ds-koszul-obstruction) explains the failure mechanism: Koszulness descends through DS iff the BRST cohomology inherits one-loop exactness. General case beyond the affine lineage remains open.
- **Homotopy-Koszulity of SC^{ch,top} is PROVED** (Theorem thm:homotopy-Koszul): via Kontsevich formality + transfer from classical Swiss-cheese (Livernet). ALL formerly conditional results (bar-cobar Quillen equivalence, filtered Koszul duality, C_line ≃ A!-mod, dg-shifted Yangian) are now unconditional.
- **Spectral Drinfeld strictification is PROVED** (Theorem thm:complete-strictification in dg_shifted_factorization_bridge.tex) for all filtrations and all simple Lie algebras: root multiplicity one forces the spectral Drinfeld class to vanish at every filtration, via root-space one-dimensionality (Theorem thm:root-space-one-dim) and the Jacobi collapse lemma (Lemma lem:jacobi-collapse). The true remaining frontier is Kac-Moody algebras with root multiplicities > 1, where root-space one-dimensionality fails and the strictification mechanism requires new input.
- The **Koszul dual is the boundary**, not the bulk: A! lives on the boundary ℝ, not in the bulk ℂ × ℝ.

## Anti-Patterns (inherited from Vol I + Vol II-specific)

All Vol I anti-patterns AP1-AP18 apply here. Additionally:

**AP19 — Label prefix mismatch.** thm: on remarks, def: on propositions. Label prefix MUST match environment type.
**AP20 — Theorem environment with non-proved status.** \begin{theorem} with \ClaimStatusConjectured is contradictory. Use \begin{conjecture}.
**AP21 — Status tag on wrong environment type.** ProvedHere on definitions or on heuristic discussions.
**AP22 — OPE confused with collision residue.** r-matrix pole orders are ONE LESS than OPE pole orders (extraction via d log absorbs one power).
**AP23 — κ vs κ_eff vs m₀ conflation.** κ(A) = modular characteristic. κ_eff = ghost-subtracted. m₀ = κ·ω_g. u = η² = κ·ω_g (LINEAR). F_g uses κ, not κ_eff.

- Claim tags match Vol I: \ClaimStatusProvedHere, \ClaimStatusProvedElsewhere, \ClaimStatusConjectured, \ClaimStatusHeuristic, \ClaimStatusOpen
- Key macros: \cA, \Ainf, \Linf, \barB, \Omegach, \hh, \HH, \Sym, \End
- Chapters moved from Vol I retain mathematical content verbatim; cite keys mapped to Vol II bibliography
- Do not add packages without checking preamble
- Do not create new files when content belongs in existing chapters
- Do not duplicate definitions from Vol I — reference them textually

## The Aesthetic

Show, don't tell. Every construction should feel inevitable — a single phenomenon viewed from different angles, not parts assembled. The Steinberg variety presents the Hecke algebra; the bar complex presents the Swiss-cheese algebra; the transgression algebra presents the holographic dictionary; the complementarity potential presents the nonlinear modular shadows. Synthesize disparate mathematical domains to bring out their inner wonder and music.
