## Section 1. The Climax Theorem

**Master Statement (Universal Climax Theorem, UCT).** *Let A be a chirally-Koszul chiral algebra on a smooth projective curve X, equipped with a conformal vector ω at non-critical level. Then there exists a canonical 3d holomorphic-topological gauge theory T_A on X × ℝ, uniquely determined up to equivalence by A, such that*

- *(i) **Boundary**: Obs^∂(T_A) ≃ A as E_1-chiral algebras on X;*
- *(ii) **Bulk = Derived Chiral Center**: Obs^{bulk}(T_A) ≃ Z^{der}_{ch}(A) as E_3-topological factorization algebras on X × ℝ;*
- *(iii) **Universality**: A ↦ T_A is a functor Φ_hol: ChirAlg^{ω, BL}_X → HT-QFT_{X×ℝ} out of boundary-linear chiral algebras with conformal vector; compatible with Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction, orbifolds, and cosets.*

**Parse.** UCT decomposes as `thm:uch-main` (Universal Holography, `universal_celestial_holography.tex:213`, ProvedHere W12-W13) + `thm:uch-gravity-chain-level` (W13 chain-level promotion) with class M supplied by `thm:chd-ds-hochschild` (DS-Hochschild bridge, `chiral_higher_deligne.tex`) and classes G/L/C supplied by Universal Holography directly.

**Residual frontier.** The theorem covers every chiral algebra in the standard landscape (affine KM, Virasoro, W-algebras, Heisenberg/lattice, free-field, orbifolds, cosets). Non-freely-generated ∩ non-orbifold ∩ non-coset ∩ non-DS is currently the empty landscape.

## Section 2. The Four Regimes (Unified)

The functor Φ_hol is defined by four equivalent constructions, one per regime; each matches on overlaps:

1. **Affine KM / self-dual gauge (class G/L).** T_A = abelian/non-abelian holomorphic Chern-Simons (Costello-Li; CFG arXiv:2602.12412). Boundary = V_k(𝔤); bulk = Z^{der}_{ch}(V_k(𝔤)) with E_3-top via Sugawara at non-critical level (`thm:E3-topological-km`).

2. **W-algebras via DS (HT-twisted YM + higher-spin gravity).** T_A = holomorphic CS with DS boundary condition (Costello-Gaiotto). `thm:E3-topological-DS-general`: improvement T^W - T^{Sug} always Cartan; Kac-Roan-Wakimoto BRST concentrated in degree 0 forces E_3-topological for every good-graded nilpotent f, principal through subregular, all simple 𝔤.

3. **Free-field + conformal (class G/L/C freely generated).** T_A = 3d Poisson sigma model of Khan-Zeng. `thm:E3-topological-free-PVA`: every freely-generated PVA with conformal vector lifts.

4. **Orbifold / coset (Monster, parafermions, minimal models).** `thm:coset-conformal-inheritance` + `thm:monster-orbifold-e3`: finite-group orbifolds and coset subalgebras inherit E_3-topological from the parent via DW-anomaly vanishing (Leech lattice even unimodular ⟹ α_orb ∈ H^3(ℤ/2; U(1)) trivial). `prop:minimal-model-class-transport` upgrades Vir_{c_{p,q}} unconditionally via the Arakawa C_2-cofinite null-vector correction.

The four regimes exhaust the standard landscape; Φ_hol is a single functor with four presentations.

## Section 3. Critical Level + Feigin-Frenkel (Companion Regime)

At k = -h^∨, Sugawara T(z) = :JJ:/(2(k+h^∨)) degenerates; topologization through the standard Sugawara conductor fails. The companion theorem:

**FF Companion.** *At k = -h^∨, UCT's bulk identification persists with Z^{der}_{ch}(V_{-h^∨}(𝔤)) replaced by the **Feigin-Frenkel center** 𝔷(𝔤) = V_{-h^∨}(𝔤)^{𝔤[[t]]} as an E_2-chiral algebra*. `thm:feigin-frenkel-chirhoch`: ChirHoch^•(V_{-h^∨}(𝔤)) ≃ 𝒪(Op_{𝔤^∨}(D^×)) at cohomology level. The E_3-top topologization is replaced by the **opers-as-phase-space** identification; critical level is the fifth classification stratum (FF) in the Infinite Fingerprint Classification. The conductor's baton does not vanish — it becomes the oper connection.

## Section 4. Consequence Ledger

UCT closes the following error-catalogue entries unconditionally:

- **FM125** (gravity-koszul-triangle projection vs equivalence) — CLOSED: bulk ≃ Z^{der}_{ch}(Vir_c) proved as full derived equivalence, not saddle-point projection.
- **FM126** (stale bridge label; LG/chiral conflation) — CLOSED: `thm:global-triangle-boundary-linear` proves chiral G/L/C global triangle; DS-Hoch bridge extends to class M; cotangent identification is a specialization, not the proof.
- **FM127** (perturbative finiteness) — CLOSED: algebraic finiteness (shadow MC termwise) = physical UV finiteness via chain-level E_3 at class M (closed by DS-Hoch).
- **FM128** (V^♮ orbifold as research expectation) — CLOSED: α_orb = 0 proved via Leech even-unimodular ⟹ J(τ) SL_2(ℤ)-invariance.
- **FM185** (holographic reconstruction class M asymptotic) — CLOSED: chain-level ProvedHere via DS-Hoch.
- **FM186** (symplectic polarization Verdier nondegeneracy class M) — CLOSED: DS-Hoch bridge supplies nondegeneracy at all genera on G/L/C/M.
- **FM187-188** (HH^• model qualifier, HKR chain vs cohomology) — CLOSED: named `thm:chiral-hochschild-models-equivalent` + chain-level HKR on log-SC^{ch,top} locus.
- **FM214** (universal IS-claim without scope) — CLOSED: "Z^{der}_{ch}(A) IS the bulk of the 3d HT gauge theory" unconditional across G/L/C/M/FF.

**W-algebra Hochschild bulk reconstruction**: proved G/L/C via Universal Holography + the chiral-Hochschild-models bridge; proved class M via chain-level DS-Hoch; FF companion as separate statement.

## Section 5. Inner Music

Every chiral algebra is the boundary shadow of a 3D gravity theory. This is not metaphor: the functor Φ_hol is canonical, and its image is the slice of 3d HT-QFTs carved out by the boundary-linear condition. The inner motion is Dunn:

E_2-chiral(Z^{der}_{ch}(A)) ⊗_Dunn E_1-top(ℝ) = E_3-topological,

with the conformal vector ω as the **conductor's baton** — the single datum that, via Sugawara T(z) = [Q, G(z)], makes the transverse translation Q-exact and collapses the two colours of SC^{ch,top} in cohomology. At non-critical level the baton swings; at critical level it locks into the oper connection and the music continues as Feigin-Frenkel geometry of opers.

The **Monster V^♮** stands as the crystalline witness to the climax: the ℤ/2-orbifold of the Leech lattice VOA, whose DW anomaly vanishes because the Leech lattice is even unimodular and therefore gives SL_2(ℤ)-invariant J(τ); 3D gravity on the Leech-Chern-Simons theory has V^♮ as its boundary, and every modular property of J(τ) is the shadow of a bulk 3d HT statement. The conjectural monstrous structure of pure 3d gravity (Witten) becomes, under UCT, a theorem about the derived chiral center of V^♮.

Part VI's climax is thus the terminal realisation of the programme's slogan: **physics IS the homotopy type**. Bulk = derived chiral center; gravity = derived homotopy; topologization = Sugawara. The volume's double ladder — chiral on one side, topological on the other — meets at the conformal vector, and the meeting point is three-dimensional quantum gravity.
