### Mathematical Content

#### Section 1: The factorization substrate

**Opening paragraph.** State the ground truth directly: a chiral algebra is not an algebra over an operad. It is a factorizable D-module on the Ran space. The operad is extracted from the factorization structure by formal completion at collision points — it is the local shadow, not the governing structure. At genus 0 on P^1, local ~ global. At genus g >= 1, local != global, and the divergence IS the curvature.

**Definition (Ran space and factorization pattern).** For a smooth curve X:
- Ran(X) = colim_{S in fSet^{surj}} X^S — the space of finite non-empty subsets
- The factorization structure: for disjoint S_1, S_2 in Ran(X), the inclusion U_{S_1} x U_{S_2} -> Ran(X) induces the factorization map
- A factorizable D-module F on Ran(X): a D-module with factorization isomorphism F|_{U_I} ~ box_{i in I} F on complements of diagonals

**Definition (Chiral operations from factorization).** The chiral operations are NOT maps between fibers at points. They are:
- The restriction F^{box n}|_{Delta_{ij}} -> F^{box (n-1)} to the diagonal Delta_{ij} = {z_i = z_j} in X^n
- These are maps between D-modules supported on different diagonals
- The composition law comes from iterating diagonal restrictions — this is the factorization structure, not an operad composition

**Remark (The local shadow).** The topological operad SC^{ch,top} arises by:
1. Restricting to a formal neighborhood of a point x in X (where X ~ C)
2. Replacing the D-module structure by its formal completion (which is just a vector space with a differential)
3. Identifying the formal neighborhood of the small diagonal in X^n with FM_n(C)
This extraction loses global information: monodromy around cycles, D-module connections, period integrals. At genus 0 on P^1, the loss is trivial (P^1 - pt = C). At genus g >= 1, the loss is the curvature kappa * omega_g.

#### Section 2: BD factorization Swiss-cheese

**Definition (BD factorization Swiss-cheese algebra on Sigma_g x R).** Full definition with:
- Closed sector: factorizable D-module F_cl on Ran(Sigma_g)
- Open sector: factorization algebra F_op on Ran(R) ~ E_1-algebra
- Mixed sector: factorization module structure for configurations with closed points on Sigma_g and open points on boundary component of Sigma_g x R_{>= 0}
- Directionality: bulk -> boundary only (no open-to-closed maps)

**The genus tower from families of factorizable D-modules.** For varying g, the collection {F_cl^{(g)}} defines a family over M-bar_g. The D-module structure on Ran(Sigma_g) varies with the complex structure of Sigma_g. The curvature d_fib^2 = kappa * omega_g arises from the monodromy of the D-module connection around B-cycles of Sigma_g. This is a theorem about D-modules, not about topological operads.

**Bar complex as factorization coalgebra.** B(A) is the factorization coalgebra on Ran(X) Koszul-dual to the chiral algebra A:
- Bar differential = chiral operations dualized via factorization structure
- Bar coproduct = factorization isomorphism dualized
- At genus 0: d^2 = 0 (honest dg coalgebra)
- At genus g >= 1: d_fib^2 = kappa * omega_g (curved factorization coalgebra)

#### Section 3: CG factorization Swiss-cheese

**Definition (CG prefactorization algebra on Sigma_g x R).** Full definition with:
- Holomorphic factorization in Sigma_g direction
- Locally constant factorization in R direction
- BV quantization origin: action functional S = S_hol + S_top + S_mix
- Cosheaf descent making it a genuine factorization algebra

**Factorization homology.** integral_{Sigma_g x R} F = global sections. For varying g, produces the genus-g bar complex. The genus tower from dependence on complex structure.

**CG Koszul duality.** Ayala-Francis framework: Koszul duality for locally constant factorization algebras on R^n exchanges E_n-algebras and E_n-coalgebras. For HT product Sigma_g x R:
- R-direction: E_1 Koszul duality
- Sigma_g-direction: chiral Koszul duality
- Combined: Swiss-cheese Koszul duality

#### Section 4: Equivalence of BD and CG

**Theorem (BD-CG equivalence; ProvedHere conditional on standard comparison results).** State with precise adjectives:
- Characteristic 0
- X smooth projective
- Holomorphically translation-invariant on X, locally constant on R
- Completeness: ind-coherent on BD side, cosheaf topology on CG side

Proof through three layers:
(i) Closed (chiral): BD Thm 4.5.4 / Francis-Gaitsgory
(ii) Open (associative): Lurie HA 5.4.5.9
(iii) Mixed (Swiss-cheese): comparison of D-module and cosheaf descriptions of mixed Ran space

#### Section 5: Factorization Koszul duality and derived-coderived equivalence

**Theorem (Factorization Swiss-cheese Koszul duality; ProvedHere).** For a factorization Swiss-cheese algebra F on Sigma_g x R:
(i) Bar construction is factorization coalgebra
(ii) Cobar recovers F at genus 0 (by local homotopy-Koszulity)
(iii) Feynman transform recovers F at all genera (by Getzler-Kapranov involutivity on closed color)
(iv) Derived-coderived equivalence at all genera

**Corollary (Three models from factorization).** The three chain-level models are three gauges of the factorization structure:
- Flat = algebraic gauge (formal completion at collision points)
- Corrected holomorphic = flat gauge (universal cover)
- Curved = single-valued gauge (Sigma_g itself)
Reference Remark rem:three-models, which should be updated to cite this corollary.

#### Section 6: Aside on Latyntsev factorization quantum groups

**Remark (Connection to Latyntsev).** Develop:
- Latyntsev's Phi_q(g) as factorization algebra on Ran(P^1) -> quantum group representations via factorization homology
- Our factorization Swiss-cheese algebra -> dg-shifted Yangian (open-color projection) and chiral Hochschild (closed-color projection)
- The bridge: Latyntsev works on closed color, producing quantum groups via Ran(X). Our Yangian works on open color, producing shifted Yangians via E_1. The Swiss-cheese mixed structure mediates: R-matrix from bulk-boundary composition.
- The spectral R-matrix connection: Latyntsev's quantum R-matrix and our r(z) agree on the evaluation locus (DK-0 shadow).
- What's new: the two-colored factorization framework places both as projections of a single object.

## Part 2: Rewrites of Existing Chapters

### foundations.tex Rewrites

**Line 27: "operadic fingerprint"**
REPLACE: "This product is the operadic fingerprint of a three-dimensional holomorphic--topological (HT) field theory"
WITH: "This product is the local algebraic shadow of the factorization structure of a three-dimensional holomorphic--topological (HT) field theory"

**Lines 30-31: "governing structure is the two-colored operad"**
REPLACE: "The governing structure is the two-colored Swiss-cheese operad $\SCchtop$ with operation spaces $\FM_k(\C) \times E_1(m)$."
WITH: "The local model for this factorization structure is the two-colored Swiss-cheese operad $\SCchtop$ with operation spaces $\FM_k(\C) \times E_1(m)$, extracted from the factorization pattern by formal completion at collision points."

**Lines 364-366: "homotopy-Koszulity...operadic input"**
REPLACE: "The homotopy-Koszulity of $\SCchtop$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:homotopy-Koszul}) is the operadic input to"
WITH: "The homotopy-Koszulity of the local operadic model $\SCchtop$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:homotopy-Koszul}), reflecting the Koszulity of the underlying factorization structure (Chapter~\ref{ch:factorization-swiss-cheese}), provides the local input to"

**Lines 394-395: "SC operad is homotopy-Koszul"**
ADD qualifier after sentence: "(This is a property of the local model; the global factorization structure is the primary datum from which it is derived.)"

### introduction.tex Rewrites

**Lines 87-91: "bar complex is SCchtop-algebra" — SUPERSEDED BY AP165**
The bar complex B(A) is NEITHER an SC^{ch,top}-algebra NOR an SC^{ch,top}-coalgebra. It is an E_1 chiral coassociative coalgebra. The SC^{ch,top} structure emerges in the chiral derived center: the pair (C^bullet_{ch}(A,A), A) is the SC datum. See AP165/B54-B56 in Vol I CLAUDE.md.

**Lines 158-159, 350: SUPERSEDED BY AP165**
Same correction applies throughout: B(A) is E_1 coassociative, not SC.

**Lines 281-285: "MC element lives at genus 0"**
ADD at end of paragraph: "At genus~$0$, the local operadic model suffices; the global family structure over $\overline{\cM}_g$ requires the factorization-algebraic framework of Chapter~\ref{ch:factorization-swiss-cheese}."

### axioms.tex Rewrite

**Lines 59-101: Operadic formulation remark**
ADD at end of remark (before \end{remark}): "This operadic description is a local shadow of the factorization-categorical formulation (Chapter~\ref{ch:factorization-swiss-cheese}), obtained by evaluating the factorization structure at formal completions of collision points. At genus~$0$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$, the two descriptions coincide; at genus~$g \geq 1$, the factorization formulation carries the D-module monodromy data that produces the curvature $\dfib^{\,2} = \kappa \cdot \omega_g$, which is invisible to the local operadic description."

## main.tex Edit
Add after line 807 (Part I, after raviolo-restriction):
```latex
\input{chapters/theory/factorization_swiss_cheese}
```

## CLAUDE.md Edits
1. File map: Add "- factorization_swiss_cheese: Part I (BD and CG factorization, equivalence, Koszul duality, Latyntsev)"
2. Add to Critical Pitfalls: "- **Factorization is primary, operad is local shadow**: A chiral algebra is a factorizable D-module on Ran(X). The SC^{ch,top} operad is the formal completion at collision points — the local model. At genus 0 on P^1, local = global. At genus g >= 1, local != global; the curvature is the global excess. NEVER present the operad as the 'governing structure' — it is the local approximation."
